- I am a developer for a large non-profit organization in Philadelphia.
- I [blog](https://anthernet.com) about my experiences learning web development.
- Sometimes I [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/tonecodes) about tech, programming and other assorted randomness.
- In my spare time, I've been working with the [Echonest API](http://developer.echonest.com/) to build a music site that integrates social media with a listening experience.

Please read my post on how I went [from zero to hired web developer in 5 months](http://anthonyramella.com/blog/from-zero-to-hired/) or any other posts on my [blog](http://anthonyramella.com) for some inspiration.

I get a lot of questions by email and can't answer them all. This is a great way for anyone to ask or read questions and answers! 

#### Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
